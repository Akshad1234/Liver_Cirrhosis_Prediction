# Liver_Cirrhosis_Prediction
🧬 A machine learning project to predict the likelihood of liver cirrhosis using patient medical data and clinical features. 🏥 Helps in early diagnosis and risk assessment by classifying liver disease severity using supervised learning.
# 🧬 Liver Cirrhosis Prediction

A supervised machine learning project for predicting liver cirrhosis in patients based on medical features. The goal is early detection and diagnosis support for healthcare providers.

## 🧠 Problem Statement
Build a classification model to predict if a patient is likely to develop liver cirrhosis using medical records, helping in early intervention and treatment.

## 📂 Dataset Features (example)
- `Age`: Patient's age
- `Sex`: Male/Female (encoded)
- `Total_Bilirubin`, `Direct_Bilirubin`: Liver function indicators
- `Alkaline_Phosphotase`, `SGPT`, `SGOT`: Enzyme levels
- `Total_Proteins`, `Albumin`, `Albumin_and_Globulin_Ratio`: Protein levels
- `Class`: Target (1 = Cirrhosis, 2 = No Cirrhosis)

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🧪 Model Workflow
1. Data Preprocessing & Imputation
2. Feature Selection & Scaling
3. Model Training (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.)
4. Performance Evaluation (ROC-AUC, Precision, Recall, F1-Score)

## ✅ Results
High sensitivity models ensure better early detection. Random Forest and XGBoost performed best.

## 🏥 Use Case
Assists doctors with risk assessment and improves early diagnosis of liver cirrhosis.
